# Heavy: AI-Powered DeFi Strategist

Heavy is an AI-powered DeFi strategist that automates the discovery, evaluation, and execution of complex, multi-chain DeFi strategies. It leverages real-time market data, on-chain analysis, and advanced risk assessment to optimize yield generation and capital efficiency.

## Key Features

* **Automated Strategy Discovery:** Heavy continuously scans the DeFi landscape for profitable opportunities across multiple chains and protocols.
* **AI-Driven Refinement:** Advanced AI agents analyze and refine strategies, considering factors like APY, TVL, risk, and historical performance.
* **Dynamic Fee Optimization:** Heavy leverages dynamic fee protocols like Uniswap v4 to minimize trading costs and maximize returns.
* **Cross-Chain Bridging:** The system seamlessly bridges assets between chains to access optimal yield opportunities.
* **Risk Management:** Sophisticated risk assessment tools evaluate and mitigate risks associated with various DeFi strategies.
* **Performance Tracking:** Heavy meticulously tracks performance metrics, providing insights into strategy effectiveness and areas for improvement.
* **Modular and Extensible:** The system is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy integration of new protocols and strategies.

## Architecture

Heavy's architecture consists of several key components:

* **Agents:**
    * **Orchestrator Agent:** Coordinates the overall operation and workflow of the system.
    * **Strategy Agent:** Discovers and selects optimal DeFi strategies based on market conditions and risk tolerance.
    * **Refinement Agent:** Refines strategies using AI and real-time market data.
    * **Execution Agent:** Executes the chosen strategies, including trades, bridging, and yield farming.
    * **Risk Agent:** Assesses and mitigates risks associated with various DeFi activities.
* **Plugins:**
    * **Yield Farming:** Integrates with various yield farming protocols, including multi-pool farms and those requiring cross-chain bridging.
    * **Bridging:** Enables seamless cross-chain asset transfers using Hop Protocol.
    * **Cow Protocol:** Leverages Cow Protocol's batch auctions for efficient and MEV-resistant trading.
    * **Morpho:** Integrates with Morpho Protocol for optimized lending and borrowing strategies.
    * **Token Discovery:** Dynamically discovers and registers new tokens using CoinGecko's API.
* **Monitors:**
    * **On-Chain Event Monitoring:** Monitors on-chain events, such as new Uniswap v4 hooks, to identify emerging opportunities.
    * **GitHub Repository Monitoring:** Tracks code changes in DeFi repositories to proactively discover new protocols and strategies.
* **Data Sources:**
    * **DeFiLlama:** Fetches real-time market data for various DeFi protocols.
    * **Chainlink:** Retrieves price data from Chainlink's decentralized oracle network.
    * **CoinGecko:** Provides token information and historical price data.
* **Performance Tracking:**
    * **Performance Plugin:** Records and analyzes performance metrics, including net gains, ROI, and risk-adjusted returns.
    * **Remote Monitoring:** Optionally posts performance data to remote monitoring services for visualization and analysis.

## Installation and Usage

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python 3.8+
*   Node.js and npm
*   PostgreSQL database
*   Required API keys (e.g., Infura, Etherscan, CoinGecko)

**Setup:**

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Configure environment variables in a `.env` file.
3.  Install Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4.  Set up the PostgreSQL database.

**Running:**

1.  Start the core system using `python src/heavy/main.py`.
2.  Run the performance dashboard (if needed) using `cd defi-dashboard && npm install && npm start`.

## Configuration

Heavy's behavior is highly configurable through the `@master_config.json` file. You can adjust parameters like risk tolerance, slippage thresholds, bridging settings, and more.
